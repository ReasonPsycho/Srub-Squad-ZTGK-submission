Our project had to complie with the requirements for game development category:

- *No Pre-Made Game Engines:* We built the game without using any ready-to-use engines, relying only on frameworks.
- *Framework Usage:* The framework was used solely for low-level systems like rendering, input, memory management, basic collision detection, and file parsing.
- *Custom Implementations:* We developed all key systems, ECS, Rendering, Lighting, AI, scene management, gameplay, advanced shaders, and scripting.
- *Asset Licensing:* All assets used are original or properly licensed. 

This project showcases our work in creating a custom engine and core systems from the ground up.
